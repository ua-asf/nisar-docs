# Critical Infrastructure monitoring

## Water Management Infrastructure

Levees and dams serve multiple functions besides their primary function of flood prevention. Dams provide hydroelectric power, store and protect the water supply, and provide recreation areas where people relax, and where fish, birds, and game live and breed. Levees do not just keep water from inundating the land, but also channel water to communities and businesses where it is needed. 

Remote sensing can improve upon and augment the traditional methods of detecting slope failures, subsidence, and seepage, all of which are indicators of the health of the infrastructure. Instead of determining ground movement from a change in two or more measurements of elevation, it is possible using NISAR to measure surface movement directly without knowledge of absolute surface elevation.

* Transportation  
* Facility situational awareness
