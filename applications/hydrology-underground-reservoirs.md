## Flood delineation and forecasting

Flooding destroys property and infrastructure, and claims tens of thousands of lives every year, first from the flooding itself and then due to food insecurity caused by destroyed crops. 

Due to water’s high dielectric constant, calm surface water can be easily detected using SAR imagery. This makes SAR backscatter an excellent resource for determining flood inundation extents. The longer wavelength of NISAR’s L-band sensor allows for the signal to penetrate through vegetation more effectively than C-band signals, making it more suitable for detecting inundated vegetation and delineating wetlands.

Because peak flooding can last for a short time, it may not be captured by NISAR’s 12-day repeat cycle.. To forecast flooding, SAR imagery data must be combined with another more frequent data source, such as precipitation or river discharge data. Once a long enough record of SAR imagery is available (generally 3 years or more), it can be correlated to another data source. This allows potential flood areas to be identified, and can provide guidance for which crops to harvest early to prevent food shortages.
