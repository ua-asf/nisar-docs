# Geologic and land hazard monitoring

## Earthquakes

Earthquakes occur suddenly, often with intense ground shaking that causes loss of life and  
property. They and their aftershocks can induce landslides, lead to fires, and even bring  
neighboring faults closer to rupture. InSAR analysis can be used to measure ground displacement associated with earthquakes as well as continued motion as faults continue to slip aseismically after large earthquakes. Surface disruption can also be measured with radar providing a proxy of where specifically damage occurs to buildings. 

## Volcanoes

Volcanic eruptions produce a large range of associated hazards. Explosive eruptions eject ballistic rock fragments that can impact the surface up to several kilometers away from the vent. Smaller fragments are carried upward in eruption columns that sometimes reach the stratosphere, forming eruption clouds that pose a serious hazard to aircraft. Volcanic ash fall can collapse buildings, and even minor amounts can impact electrical systems. Volcanic gases contribute to health problems, and also to acid rain that causes corrosion and damage to regional ecosystems. Lava flows inundate property and destroy infrastructure. Volcanic mudflows have the potential to devastate entire cities even far from the source volcano. 

Data from NISAR and other radar missions allow us to identify and monitor surface deformation at quiescent and active volcanoes using InSAR. Only InSAR has the capability to monitor deformation at virtually all of the world’s potentially active volcanoes on land. InSAR observations allow us to build models of subsurface magma movement preceding, accompanying, and following eruptions.

## Sinkholes

Sinkholes form in many ways, all of which lead to collapse of the overburden soil above an underground void. Naturally occurring sinkholes form in areas where the rock can dissolve in water, which could be due to erosion or an underground stream. However, sinkholes also can form more slowly as gentle depressions that indicate where the rock is dissolving below ground. 

Regular imaging with NISAR, which will image nearly all land globally, potentially detects movement started days prior to the collapse. InSAR analysis can be used to quickly and efficiently identify slow-collapse sinkholes that can cause damage to structures, protecting lives and property.

## Landslides

Landslides and related slope movements can begin and move in a wide variety of ways, depending on the geology, soil and ground-water conditions, vegetation cover, and weather. Some landslides move at rates of a fraction of an inch per year. Others fail catastrophically and travel at rates of tens of miles per hour. Landslide sizes also vary greatly, from small shallow slumps and slides that are only a couple yards across to large deep-seated slides and flows that can reach lengths of several miles. 

NISAR will be able to measure ground surface movement directly through repeat imaging of landslide prone regions and processing the sequence of images using InSAR. One major advantage of InSAR is that it can be used to measure surface deformation directly across large areas (hundreds of miles) with far greater accuracy than is possible with other commonly used remote sensing or ground-based monitoring techniques (e.g., GPS surveying).
