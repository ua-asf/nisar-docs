# Ecosystem applications

## Agriculture

NISAR acquisitions support mapping agricultural regions globally every two weeks. The structures of different crop and land cover types provide a rich variety of responses to the radar illumination in terms of varying polarization and frequency signatures. 

Because of the rapid, time-varying nature of crop rotation, growth, and harvest, frequently repeated radar observations can be used to determine both the type of crop and its stage of growth. Information like this is used to predict the health of crops and planned agricultural output as a measure for food security.

## Forestry

Forests protect water resources, provide air purification, and reduce erosion. They are key to  
sustaining crucial biodiversity and enhancing conditions for agricultural production. Forests also serve a social function as a recreational resource, an important labor market, and living space, and they enhance national defense. Both the amplitude and phase components of NISAR products can be useful for forestry applications. 

When forest canopies are disturbed by the full or partial removal of standing trees, or significant fractions of the upper canopy are lost due to forest fire or pest infestations, the changes are reflected in a rich variety of measurable radar signals. NISAR provides a consistent time-series that can be used to track when, where, and by how much forests have been altered. 

One of the greatest challenges facing forest managers around the world is maintaining the health and resilience of the forest ecosystems. This requires a coordinated and systematic effort for monitoring forest cover, volume, and productivity, and the development of techniques and policies for improving the stock and sustainable use of woody biomass. NISAR helps by generating large-scale maps needed to more accurately predict forest biomass, fuel loads, fire risk, and fire behavior.

## Fires

Fires are crucial to many ecosystems, yet often threaten developed urban areas, protected lands and regional air quality. Categorizing fire danger, detecting fires, identifying burned areas and quantifying the severity of fires is critical for mitigating the impacts of fire. 

The structures of different land cover types provide a rich variety of responses to the radar illumination through time-varying polarization signatures. Because of the rapid changes in structure and composition after a disturbance like wildfire, radar backscatter may be useful for determining areas that burned, even when traditional methods do not work well.
