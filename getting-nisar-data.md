# Getting NISAR Data

Access to NISAR data is currently restricted to a website that stages a [NISAR Sample Data Product Suite](https://nisar.jpl.nasa.gov/data/sample-data/). 

Once NISAR has been launched and data is available, users will be able to discover and access the data using the same platforms NASA has made available for accessing other SAR datasets. All NISAR products will be archived by ASF, and can be discovered through the [Vertex Data Search](https://search.asf.alaska.edu/#/) and [Earthdata Search](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/) map-based web interfaces. In addition, users can leverage the [asf\_search Python package](https://docs.asf.alaska.edu/asf_search/basics/) to programmatically search for and access NISAR data.
