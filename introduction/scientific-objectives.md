The [NISAR Mission Science Users' Handbook](https://assets.science.nasa.gov/content/dam/science/missions/nisar/nisar-jpl/pdf/NISAR_FINAL_9-6-19.pdf) (2019) defined the key scientific objectives as follows:

*NISAR addresses the needs of Solid Earth, Ecosystems, and Cryospheric science disciplines, and provides data for many applications. NISAR is an all-weather, global geodetic and polarimetric radar-imaging mission with the following key scientific objectives:*

1. *Determine the likelihood of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides and land subsidence;*  
2. *Understand the dynamics of carbon storage and uptake in wooded, agricultural, wetland, and permafrost systems;*  
3. *Understand the response of ice sheets to climate change, the interaction of sea ice and climate, and impacts on sea level rise worldwide.*
