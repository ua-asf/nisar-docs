## Algorithm Theoretical Basis Documents

Two algorithm theoretical basis documents (ATBDs) summarize how the data is processed at various processing levels:
- NISAR L1 and L2 Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document [@algorithm_l1_l2_atbd2023]
- NISAR L3 Soil Moisture Data Product: Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) [@algorithm_l3_atbd2023]

There are other ATBDs summarizing the findings of the NISAR science team regarding how the requirements for generating particular data products are met:  
- Algorithms to Validate NISAR L2 Coseismic, Transient and Secular Displacement Requirements [@displacement_atbd2022]  
- NISAR L3 Ice Sheets and Glacier Products [@ice_sheets_glaciers_atbd2022]  
- NISAR L2 Sea Ice Motion Product [@sea_ice_motion_atbd2022]  
- NISAR Ecosystem L2 Products [@ecosystem_atbd2018]
