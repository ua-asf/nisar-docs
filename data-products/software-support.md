# Software that supports reading/viewing/using NISAR data

There are several software packages and tools that can be used to interact with all NISAR products except L0B RRSD data. L0 level data is unprocessed and has very limited viewability. 

Instructions for working with NISAR L2 and L3 data formats in ArcGIS, QGIS, and Panoply are provided in ASF’s [Work with NISAR Sample Data](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/tutorials/work-nisar-sample-data) documentation. 

The documentation also provides guidance for using GDAL command line tools for these tasks:

* Getting Sub-dataset / Group Paths  
* Convert from NISAR H5 to GeoTIFF  
* Reproject a Single Subdataset from NISAR H5 Data  
* Reproject an Entire NISAR H5 Dataset  
* Clip a NISAR H5 Dataset to a Geographic Extent  
* Create a Multiband GeoTIFF with a NISAR Dataset
