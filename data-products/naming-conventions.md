# NISAR Naming Conventions

There are three different patterns used for naming NISAR data products, depending on the product type:
1. Raw Data Products
2. Products Generated from a Single Acquisition
3. Products Generated from Pairs of Acquisitions

## Raw Data Products

This naming convention is only used for Level 0B (L0 RRSD) products.
