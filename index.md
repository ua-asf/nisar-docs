# NISAR User Guide

The joint NASA/ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) platform provides a better understanding of changes in Earth’s ecosystems, ice mass, vegetation biomass, sea level rise, groundwater, and natural hazards.

NISAR's dual-band radar systematically maps Earth day and night and in any weather, measuring changes of our planet's surface as small as a centimeter.

All NISAR science data is freely available and open to the public, consistent with the long-standing NASA Earth Science open data policy.

This site aims to help those who research and monitor the Earth realize the most value from NISAR by answering all of their questions about NISAR data in one place.
