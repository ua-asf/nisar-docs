# Level 2

NISAR L2 data products are geocoded L1 products projected to a map coordinate system.

The L2 **Gecoded Single Look Complex (GSLC)** product is map projected using the Medium precision Orbit Ephemeris (MOE) state vectors and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM).

The L2 **Geocoded Nearest-Time Pixel Offsets (GOFF)** product provides unfiltered and unculled layers of pixel offsets in different resolutions obtained from incoherent cross-correlation. 

The L2 **Geocoded Nearest-Time Unwrapped Interferogram (GUNW)** is a multi-looked unwrapped interferogram that is ellipsoid- and topography-flattened. Only nearest-neighbor pairs are processed; GUNW products with longer temporal baselines are not automatically generated by the NISAR mission.

The L2 **Geocoded Polarimetric Covariance Matrix (GCOV)** is a multi-looked polarimetric covariance matrix using MOE state vectors and a DEM.
