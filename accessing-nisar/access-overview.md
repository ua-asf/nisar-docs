# Access Overview

NISAR mission data products are generated by [JPL](../about-nisar#jet-propulsion-laboratory) and archived by [ASF](../about-nisar#alaska-satellite-facility). These products, described in the [Data Products section](../data-products/products-overview), are hosted in [NASA's Earthdata Cloud (EDC)](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/about/earthdata-cloud-evolution), which uses AWS infrastructure. This allows users to leverage cloud-based access and computation workflows, though the products can also be downloaded to local storage. 

There are a range of access options available for NISAR, supporting a range of access patterns and analysis workflows. 

## Map-based Web Applications

Map-based web interfaces make it easy to explore data available for a particular geographic location and visualize the extent and characteristics of the products.
