# Access Overview

NISAR mission data products are generated by [JPL](../about-nisar/nisar-intro.md#jet-propulsion-laboratory) and archived by [ASF](../about-nisar/nisar-intro#alaska-satellite-facility). These products, described in the [Data Products section](../data-products/products-overview#data-products-overview), are hosted in [NASA's Earthdata Cloud (EDC)](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/about/earthdata-cloud-evolution), which uses AWS infrastructure. This allows users to leverage cloud-based access and computation workflows, though the products can also be downloaded to local storage. 

There are a range of access options available for NISAR, supporting a range of access patterns and analysis workflows. 

:::{important}
There are not yet any NISAR products available to the public. The NISAR mission team is working on validating the products to ensure they meet mission requirements before they are released.

The infrastructure is in place to make the products available as soon as they are approved for release, but the illustrations currently included in this documentation site are examples of what _will_ be possible. The results displayed will not be reproducible until the data is publicly available.

## Map-based Web Applications

Map-based web interfaces make it easy to explore data available for a particular geographic location and visualize the extent and characteristics of the products. 

* ASF's [Vertex](#vertex) data search site is optimized for searching NASA's SAR holdings
* NASA's [Earthdata Search](#earthdata-search) provides access to all of NASA's Earth observation datasets

### Vertex

[Vertex](https://search.asf.alaska.edu/#/) was developed by ASF to facilitate search and discovery specifically for SAR datasets.

Because search parameters of interest for SAR differ from other types of Earth observation data, it can be helpful to use a platform that is tailored to the parameters and characteristics of SAR data. This is particularly useful for those who are less familiar with SAR data products and may need more guidance to find the appropriate dataset for their use case.
